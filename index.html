<p> From a technical standpoint, video games are really interesting. Not only they impose the players rules that virtually can’t be broken, but they also heavily rely on parsing, AI, networking, external execution units (scripts) and others interesting stuff. The biggest games are massive though. Yet, I managed to find a small French “amateur-ish” MMORPG that I thought would be quick to study. It was actually a quite interesting project.</p> <p>Online games are usually interesting to reverse for their network protocols. Digging around in Wireshark, I was unable to correlate in-game...</p>
